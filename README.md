This repository contains a Python code which models 1 & 2-D diffraction patterns using Simpsonâ€™s approximation of the Fresnel Integral..

A pdf is also included providing a detailed description of the archetecture of the code, the mathematical framework on which it is based and a full analysis and discussion of the plots produced by the simulation.
